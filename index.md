The Games, Optimization, Algorithms, and Learning Lab (GoalLab) studies theory of machine learning  and its interface with learning in games and algorithmic game theory, optimization, dynamical systems, probability and statistics.

# Research Highlights
Below we provide our main research areas of interest with selected publications

Our recent focus has been on finding Nash equilibria in Markov games. Two representative papers include computing Nash Equilibria in [Adversarial Team Markov Games.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02204) and [in Markov Potential Games.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01969) <br/>
